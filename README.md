### [PolarizedLight](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/use_links_below/PolarizedLight.pdf) & [InterferenceEffects](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/use_links_below/InterferenceEffects.pdf)
 
These papers fufilled a required writing component add-on to a physics course, in this case Waves & Optics (PHYS 1361).  
     
The writing component required choosing two of our weekly labs and writing them as if being submitted to a scientific journal. Each student in a group wrote their own individual papers. Both of mine received an A.
