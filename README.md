This paper won a Thomas Lain Scholarship in 2018. The award was based on scientific understanding<br>
of the topic and also clarity of writing. 
 
The essay contest prompt was:

### [OpticsPaper1](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/OpticsPaper1.pdf) & [OpticsPaper2](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/OpticsPaper2.pdf)
 
These papers fufilled a required 1-credit writing component add-on to a physics course, in this case<br>
Waves & Optics (PHYS 1361). 

The writing component required choosing two of our weekly labs and writing them as if being<br>
submitted to a scientific journal. Each student in the lab group wrote their own papers, and<br>
both of mine received an A.
