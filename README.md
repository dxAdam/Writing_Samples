# Writing Samples 
 
### [Quantum Entanglement and the Theta Tau Puzzle](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/use_links_below/QuantumEntanglement.pdf)
 
This paper won a Thomas Lain Scholarship in 2018. The award was based on scientific understanding of the topic and also clarity of writing and use of the English language. 
 
The essay contest prompt was: 

&nbsp; &nbsp; "Discuss the concept of quantum entanglement and its relationship to the theta-tau puzzle." 
 
 
### [The effect of reflection and polarizers on linear polarized light](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/use_links_below/PolarizedLight.pdf) &<br>[Interference effects with an amplitude splitting interferometer](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/use_links_below/InterferenceEffects.pdf)
 
These papers fufilled a required writing component add-on to a physics course, in this case Waves & Optics.  
     
The writing component required choosing two of our weekly labs and writing them as if being submitted to a scientific journal. Each student in a group wrote their own individual papers. Both of mine received an A.  


### [Physical Concepts in Spintronics](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/use_links_below/Spintronics.pdf)

This paper was the result of a research project in my Solid State Physics course. Each student picked a different solid state physics topic and spent several weeks researching it in place of homework. 

I chose to research spintronics because I found it an interesting topic that could lead to many new devices and methods of computation. It was also a good way to learn more about spin and other quantum effects and interactions at the electron level. The paper along with a presentation I gave in class were worth 25% of my final grade, I received 100% on the project.
