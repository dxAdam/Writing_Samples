This paper won a Thomas Lain Scholarship in 2018. The award was based on scientific understanding of the topic and also clarity of writing. 
 
The essay contest prompt was: 

&nbsp; "Discuss the concept of quantum entanglement and its relationship to the theta-tau puzzle." 
 
 
### [OpticsPaper1](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/OpticsPaper1.pdf) & [OpticsPaper2](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/dxAdam/Writing_Samples/raw/master/OpticsPaper2.pdf)
 
These papers were assignments in my Waves & Optics course (PHYS 1361). Each assignment was to write up one of our weekly labs as if we were going to submit them to a scientific journal. Each student in the group wrote their own individual papers.



note: The papers look much better if downloaded and viewed on an actual pdf
viewer.
